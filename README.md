# MontrealZeroGo

In the years 2017-2018, the world has witnessed the very success of Google's AlphaGo by way of AI (Artificial Intelligence).

According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game), Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. As of mid-2008, there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the majority of them living in East Asia. As of December 2015, the International Go Federation has a total of 75 member countries and four Association Membership organizations in multiple countries.

Montréal is now a major global hub for artificial intelligence (AI) research and it’s AI ecosystem is thriving (https://www.ibm.com/blogs/insights-on-business/ibmix/montreal-became-worlds-leading-ai-deep-learning-hub/).

Montréal boasts an exceptionally high concentration of expertise in the area of AI, thanks in part to the efforts of Université de Montréal professor Yoshua Bengio, one of the founding fathers of the deep learning movement and head of the Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) (https://mila.quebec/). McGill University and Université de Montréal have more than 250 researchers and doctoral students in fields related to artificial intelligence, the largest AI academic community in the world. Montréal also has famous researchers in automatic speech recognition, computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

On other hand, Montreal, on June 2006, Montréal was officially designated a UNESCO City of Design, joining the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/).

In this project, we will pool resources to build MontrealZeorGo:

1. To showcase the AI technologies made in Montreal.
2. To promote the technological exchanges between AI companies in Montreal and around the world
3. To compete in international stage when it is mature
4. Others
